            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p> I graduated with a bachelor's degree in <em>
                    Computer Science in May, 2021 </em> and currently work as a <em> Data Engineer. </em> I am
                passionate about all things related to tech,
                data and
                coffee. </p>

                <h3>Design and Development</h3>
                <p>I started learning to code during my freshman year of high school and fell in love
                    with the logical,
                    analytical, and creative world of programming. Ever since, I have been learning and gaining
                    experience in various design and development skills through an undergraduate degree, bootcamp, work,
                    and side projects. </p>

                <h3>Tutor and Mentor</h3>
                <p> In my free time, I like to work as a tutor and mentor at Girls Who Code for high school and college
                    students
                    supporting them while they dive deeper in the field of technology. I also like to lead weekly coffee
                    chats with members of the Women In Technology group at Wells Fargo.
